[*] Summary
 An implementation of Quine-McCluskey algorithm
 Simplification of logical expressions

[+] Requirements
    [+] Compile Time
        [*] Make
        [*] C++11 compiler (Search about C++11 if you don't know about it)
            (ex. GCC, clang, ICC,
             and you have to realize VC++ is NOT a C++ compiler. it actually supports C++03, not C++11
            )
        [*] Boost C++ Libraries
            Almost all the libraries I use are header-only.
            But you need to build only boost_regex
            Go to www.boost.org and get the source code to build it
    [+] Run time
        [*] Nothing is needed. Just run it

[+] Tested environment
    [+] Compiler
        [*] gcc 4.6.3
        [*] clang version 3.2 (trunk 159072)
    [+] Operating System
        [*] Linux 3.2.0-26-generic-pae i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux
    [+] Libraries
        [*] Boost C++ Libraries 1.50.0
